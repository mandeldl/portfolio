#To Do
- [ ] pick color palette [Coolors](http://app.coolors.co/)
- [x] import skeleton.css
- [x] activate takana

#Miscellaneous notes
- Coolors lets you export .scss!
- Does it make more sense to link to normalize and skeleton in the head, and not import them into base until ready for production?
